# AKCIT-FN 👋

### Welcome to the official GitHub organization for AKCIT-FN!

We are a research team from the [Advanced Knowledge Center in Immersive Technologies (AKCIT)](https://akcit.ufg.br/pdi/tecnicas-computacionais-seguranca-privacidade-dados-multimodais) at the Federal University of Goiás (UFG). Our work is dedicated to combating misinformation by developing advanced computational techniques for fact-checking.

This initiative is part of the broader project, "[Computational Techniques for Multimodal Data Security and Privacy](https://akcit.ufg.br/pdi/tecnicas-computacionais-seguranca-privacidade-dados-multimodais)", running from July 2024 to December 2025.

### 🏆 Publications & Achievements


#### AKCIT-FN at CheckThat! 2025: Switching Fine-Tuned SLMs and LLM Prompting for Multilingual Claim Normalization
*   In this paper, we detail our hybrid model that achieved **top-three positions in 15 of the 20 languages** in the competition.
*   Our LLM-based zero-shot strategy proved highly effective, securing second place in five of the seven languages that had no prior training data.
